<h1>Basic Information on imom</h1>

Task: imom
Purpose: Compute intensity-weighted moment of an image
Categories: image analysis

        IMOM finds the 'centroid' of a Miriad image, and the 'spread'
        about that centroid, by evaluating the expressions
          mom1 = SUM{I(x)*x} / SUM{I(x)}
          mom2 = sqrt(SUM{I(x)*(x-mom1)**2} / SUM{I(x)})
        along the first two axes of an image.
 
        Notes:
        * The first moment should always be in the range 1..naxis(n).
        * mom2 is equivalent to the standard deviation, not the FWHM,
          for a gaussian intensity distribution.
        * mom2 shows the spread along the directions parallel to the
          *image axes*. So if your object of interest is elongated along
          some random angle, the mom2 values returned will be a
          combination of the major and minor-axis sizes, projected onto
          the x- and y-axes.
        * If all pixels in the region are blank, moments of -1.0 are
          returned and a warning is printed.
        * In case of a rounding error etc, moments of 0.0 are returned
          and a warning is printed.
 

Key: <a name="in"><a href="in.html">in</a>
        Input image name. No default.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        The following options can be given (minimum match applies):
          skew
            Compute the 'third moment'. Since the formal third moment
            has the rather useless dimensions of pixel**3, what
            is actually returned is the dimensionless quantity
                 SUM{ I(x)*(x - mom1)**3 } / SUM{ I(x) } / mom2**3.
            A negative value means the distribution is skewed towards
            values less than the first moment; i.e. the pixels at
            lower pixel number than mom1 are generally brighter than
            those at higher pixel number. A positive value
            means the pixels at higher pixel number than the first
            moment are brighter.
          clipmean
            When you use this program to estimate the peak of a source,
            better accuracy can be had by ignoring low-intensity values.
            Setting this option forms the moments using only pixels that
            are brighter than the (local) mean.
            If a min or max value is specified (see below), the mean is
            computed using only the values within the selected range.
          clip1sigma
            Forms moments using just the pixels brighter than
            local_mean + local_rms.
            If a min or max value is specified, the mean and rms are
            computed using only the values within the selected range.

Key: <a name="region"><a href="region.html">region</a>
        The region of interest. See the help on <a href="region.html">region</a> for more
        information. This gives the region of pixels to calculate the
        moments within. Only rectangular regions are supported.
        The default is the entire image.
        If a cube is given as the input image, the program computes
        moments for each plane along axis 3 (within the selected range).

Key: <a name="min">min
        The minimum pixel value for inclusion in the moment calculation.
        The default is the image minimum.

Key: <a name="max">max
        The maximum pixel value for inclusion in the moment calculation
        The default is the image maximum.

Key: <a name="log">log
        The output log file. The default is the terminal. Output to
        the terminal is paged.
