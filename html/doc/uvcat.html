<h1>Basic Information on uvcat</h1>
<pre>

Task: uvcat
Purpose: Catenate and copy uv datasets; Apply gains file, Select windows.
Categories: uv analysis

        UVCAT is a MIRIAD task which copies and catenates multiple MIRIAD
        uv data sets. By default, UVCAT applies the gains file in copying the
        data. The spectral windows copied to the output file can be selected.

Key: <a name="vis"><a href="vis.html">vis</a>
        The names of the input uv data sets. Multiple names can be given,
        separated by commas. At least one name must be given.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        The normal uv selection commands. One unusual aspect of this is that
        the <a href="window.html">window</a> subcommand can be used to select which windows are
        copied to the output file (normally the <a href="window.html">window</a> only has an
        effect for velocity line type). The default is to copy everything.

Key: <a name="stokes"><a href="stokes.html">stokes</a>
        If a value is given, uvcat converts the input into the required
        polarizations before writing to the output. Default is to copy
        across the polarizations present in the input files.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        This gives extra processing options. Several options can be given,
        each separated by commas. They may be abbreivated to the minimum
        needed to avoid ambiguity. Possible options are:
           'nocal'       Do not apply the gains file. By default, UVCAT
                         applies the gains file in copying the data.
           'nopass'      Do not apply bandpass corrections. By default, UVCAT
                         applies bandpass corrections if possible.
           'nopol'       Do not apply polarization correction. By
                         default UVCAT corrects polarizations, if possible.
           'nowide'      Do not copy across wide-band channels.
           'nochannel'   Do not copy across spectral channels.
           'unflagged'   Copy only those records where there are some
                         unflagged visibilites.

Key: <a name="out"><a href="out.html">out</a>
        The name of the output uv data set. No default.
