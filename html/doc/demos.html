Task: demos
Purpose: Inverse mosaicing operation
Categories: map manipulation

        DEMOS (de-mosaic) is a MIRIAD task that takes a model of the sky
        (that is primary beam corrected), and multiplies by a primary
        beam response function at a number of different pointing
        centers.  It produces a different output for each pointing
        center.  Thus this task performs the inverse of mosaicing.  The
        input pointing centers and the primary beam size are indirectly
        specified by a visibility dataset.
 
        Because the output of DEMOS have primary beams applied, they can
        be used for comparison with visibility data and uncorrected
        images.  In particular SELFCAL cannot handle a model that is
        primary beam corrected, though it can handle a visibility data
        file containing multiple pointings.  Thus you could use DEMOS to
        break the model into several models which are not primary beam
        corrected.

Key: <a name="map">map
        This is the name of the image to be de-mosaiced.  A primary beam
        corrected image, single dish image, or one that is partially
        primary beam corrected (e.g. the output of MOSMEM).  No default.

Key: <a name="vis"><a href="vis.html">vis</a>
        This is one or more input visibility datasets.  The pointing
        centres and primary beams corresponding to the selected
        visibilities are used in the de-mosaicing process.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        Normal uv selection. See help on <a href="select.html">select</a>.  Generally you will
        select only those pointings of interest.

Key: <a name="out"><a href="out.html">out</a>
        This gives a template name for the output images.  The actual
        output image names are formed by appending a number
        corresponding to each pointing center to this output name.  For
        example, if out=cygnus, then the output images will be called
        cygnus1, cygnus2, etc.

Key: <a name="imsize">imsize
        This gives two values, being the output image size, in x and y.
        If no value is given, then the outputs will be one primary beam
        width in size. If one value is given, then this is used for both
        x and y. Each output size might be smaller than this, to prevent
        each output from extending beyond the edges of the input image.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        Extra processing options. There is currently only one option.
          detaper    This indicates that the input image is not fully
                     primary beam corrected. Such images are formed by
                     LINMOS with options=taper or by MOSMEM.
