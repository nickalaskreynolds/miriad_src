Task: bbcal
Purpose: Calibrate a CABB data set in chunks of limited bandwidth
Categories: data calibration

        bbcal is a MIRIAD script which calibrates a CABB dataset in chunks
        of limited bandwidth to allow for frequency dependent leakage and 
        complex gain variation. This script is aimed at relatively simple
	observations at cm and 12 or 7mm. If you have multiple secondary
	calibrators you'll need to run this more than once in separate
	directories or copy the scripts and modify them. The output files
	contain all fields that are not specified as 'pri', 'sec' or 'bp'.
 

Key: <a name="rpfits">rpfits
        Name of the input RPFITS file(s). Leave this empty if you've already
	loaded the data and want to start from the visibility file. 

Key: <a name="vis"><a href="vis.html">vis</a>
        Name of the visibility file. No default. Note that this file will be 
	overwritten if you've specified rpfits!

Key: <a name="pri">pri
        Name of the primary calibrator, used for fluxscale.

Key: <a name="sec">sec
        Name of the secondary calibrator. 

Key: <a name="bp">bp
        Name of the bandpass calibrator (defaults to primary)

Key: <a name="maxwidth">maxwidth
        The maximum bandwidth of the output files in GHz
