Task: imcomb
Purpose: Combine images
Categories: map combination

        IMCOMB is a MIRIAD task that combines several images into one.
        The images are weighted in the region of overlap to minimise
        the rms noise.

Key: <a name="in"><a href="in.html">in</a>
        Name of the input image datasets. Several can be given.
        Wildcards are supported. At least one must be given.

Key: <a name="out"><a href="out.html">out</a>
        The name of the output dataset.

Key: <a name="rms">rms
        The rms noise levels of each of the input images.  This is used
        in weighting the images when combining them (and thus minimising
        the noise level in any overlap region).  Only the relative
        magnitude of the noise values are important.
 
        The images are weighted as 1/rms**2 -- so if you wish the images
        to have speific weights, compute them accordingly. For example
        if you wish to weight two images by the ratios 4 to 1, use
          rms = 0.5,1
        where 0.5 is 1/sqrt(4)
 
        The default is to use the theoretical rms of the input images
        found in the image header.  If this is missing, then the last
        valid rms noise level found is used.  If no values are given,
        and the first dataset does not contain the rms value in the
        header, equal weights are used for all images.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        Extra processing options.  Several values can be given,
        separated by a comma.  Minimum match of names is used.
        Possible values are:
          nonormalise  Do not renormalise the output.  Normally the
                       output is normalised to account for overlap
                       regions.
          relax        Do not check that the coordinate systems are
                       consistent.
          fqaver       If 3rd axis (assumed to be frequency) is a
                       single plane, average the input images in
                       frequency, instead of producing a cube
                       containing all planes.
