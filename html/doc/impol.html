Task: impol
Purpose: Compute polarized intensity and position angle from Q and U
Categories: image analysis

        IMPOL computes the total linearly polarized intensity
        (optionally debiasing it) and position angle images from
        Stokes Q and U images.  Position angle is positive N -&gt; E.

Key: <a name="in"><a href="in.html">in</a>
        Up to three values; the Q, U and I images, respectively.
        The I image is only needed if you want to compute the fractional
        polarization image as well or if you want to blank the output
        based upon an I S/N ratio.  Wild card expansion is supported.

Key: <a name="poli">poli
        Up to two values; the output polarized intensity image and
        optionally, its associated error image (which will be constant).
        Default is no output images.

Key: <a name="polm">polm
        Up to two values; the output fractional polarization image and
        optionally, its associated error image.  You need to input an I
        image to keyword <a href="in.html">in</a> for this.

Key: <a name="pa">pa
        Up to two values; the output position angle image and
        optionally, its associated error image (which will not be
        constant).  These will be in degrees (but see OPTIONS=RADIANS),
        Default is no output images.

Key: <a name="sigma">sigma
        Up to two values; the mean standard deviation of the noise in
        the Q &amp; U images (i.e. one number for them both),  and the
        standard deviation of the I image.
 
        These are required for debiasing (Q,U only), or for generating
        output error images, or for blanking the output.  Try to make
        the Q,U value as accurate as possible for the debiasing.
        Perhaps measure it from a V image
        No default for sigma_QU, sigma_I defaults to sigma_QU

Key: <a name="sncut">sncut
        Up to 2 values.  The first is the S/N ratio, P/SIGMA_QU, below
        which the output images are blanked (see also options=zero
        below).  It is generally recommended that an SNCUT of at least 2
        is used.  The second value, which is only valid when you have
        input an I image and sigma, is the S/N ratio, I/SIGMA_I, below
        which output images are blanked (defaults to no I based
        blanking) The default is 2.0 and 0.0.

Key: <a name="pacut">pacut
        The output images are blanked if the error in the position
        angle image (degrees or radians depending on OPTIONS) is greater
        than this value.  This is active even if you don't output
        the PA image.   Note that there is no equivalent for the output
        error of the POLI image because the error is constant and
        equal to SIGMA.  Keyword SNCUT essentially takes care of this.
        The default is no position angle error based blanking.

Key: <a name="rm">rm
        After computing the position angle image, rotate the position
        angles back to zero wavelength by an amount specified by
        RM (rad/m**2).   Better to use IMRM to generate the rotation
        measure and zero wavelength position angle images.
        Default is 0.0

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        Task enrichment options.  Minimum match is active.
 
        "bias"     If computing polarized intensity, do NOT remove the
                   Ricean bias in the image.  By default, the bias is
                   removed to first order with P = sqrt(P_obs**2 -
                   sigma**2).  You should have a very good reason for
                   using this option (e.g. a detection experiment).  See
                   VLA memo no. 161 by Patrick Leahy for more details of
                   bias removal.
 
        "zero"     When the output pixel is clipped because the
                   debiasing fails (P**2 may become negative), setting
                   OPTIONS=ZERO will cause the output polarized
                   intensity image (not the position angle image) pixel
                   to be set to 0.0 rather than being masked out.  This
                   is very important if you are interested in doing
                   statistics on a region of low polarized intensity S/N
                   ratio.  If you leave the region masked rather than
                   zeroed, you will bias the statistics in that region -
                   zero is a better estimate of the pixel than just
                   excluding it from the statistics (provided the clip
                   level is sufficiently small). Residual bias in the
                   statistical results from the area then depend upon
                   how well the bias remover works and at what level
                   clipping was performed.  See VLA memo no. 161 by
                   Patrick Leahy.
 
        "radians"  Output the position angle image in radians instead
                   of degrees.
 
        "relax"    Only warn about image axis descriptor mismatches
                   instead of giving a fatal error

Key: <a name="device"><a href="device.html">device</a>
        PGPLOT device on which to draw a plot showing the effect of bias
        in polarized intensity images.  It plots true polarized
        intensity versus the bias, which is the estimated polarized
        intensity minus the true polarized intensity.  Three estimators
        are shown; observed, first order, and maximum likelhood.  It is
        assumed that sigma_P = 1  in these plots.  Because these plots
        are drawn following a Monte Carlo simulation of some 15,000
        trials of the noise, you will need to be patient.  You can just
        make this bias plot without actually working on any data if you
        wish. See also VLA memo no. 161 by Patrick Leahy.
        Default is no plot.
