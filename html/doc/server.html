<h1>Basic Information on server</h1>
<pre>

Key: <a name="server">server
	This is used to specify the TV display device. It is giving in the
	form:

	  type@server

	or

	  type@device

	The first form causes a connection to be made with a network
	display server, whereas the second form uses local hardware
	directly. For the network servers, the server process may have
	to be started before invoking the Miriad task -- see below.

	Currently supported types are:

	  xmtv          Miriad X server. `server' is the servers hostname.
			Normally the xmtv server will be the same host as
			the X server. The user will normally invoke the xmtv
			server before running any Miriad TV tasks, with

			  % xmtv &amp;

			If the X server and xmtv server are on different
			hosts, you may need to set the DISPLAY environment
			variable on the xmtv server, and use xhost on the
			X server.

	  ivas		IVAS (VMS only). `device' is the VMS device name.
			You will require an IIS IVAS for this.

	  ivserver	IVAS server. `server' is the servers hostname.
			Servers are currently installed on
			castor.astro.uiuc.edu and bkyast.berkeley.edu.

	  msss		Miriad Sun Screen server. `server' is the serving
			Sun, which can be any Sun with a console. The user
			will normally invoke the server before running
			any Miriad TV tasks, with

			  % msss &amp;

	  mxas		Miriad X server. `server' is the servers hostname.
			This is an inferior server to xmtv.
