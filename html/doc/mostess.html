Task: mostess
Purpose: Maximum Entropy deconvolution for a mosaiced observation
Categories: deconvolution

        MOSMANY performs a joint maximum entropy deconvolution of a
        collection of dirty images from a mosaiced observation.
 

Key: <a name="map">map
        The input dirty maps. No default.

Key: <a name="beam">beam
        The input dirty beams. No default.

Key: <a name="default">default
        Default image name. The default is a flat image.

Key: <a name="model">model
        Name of the initial estimate. Default is a flat initial
        estimate.

Key: <a name="out"><a href="out.html">out</a>
        The name of the output map.

Key: <a name="niters">niters
        The maximum number of iterations. The default is 30.

Key: <a name="measure">measure
        The entropy measure to be used, either "gull" (-p*log(p/e)) or
        "cornwell" (-log(cosh(p)) -- also called the maximum emptiness
        criteria).

Key: <a name="tol">tol
        Tolerance of solution. There is no need to change this from the
        default of 0.01.

Key: <a name="q">q
        An estimate of the number of points per beam. MOSMEM can usually
        come up with a good, image-dependent estimate.

Key: <a name="rmsfac">rmsfac
        MOSTESS knows the theoretical rms noise of the input dirty maps,
        and will, by default, attempt to reduce the residuals to have an
        rms of this amount.  If the true rms noise is different from the
        theoretical, you may give the factor to multiply by to convert
        from theoretical to true rms noise.
 
        The theoretical rms will usually be an optimistic estimate of
        the true noise level.  The true noise will be increased by
        calibration errors, confusion, poorly understood distant
        sidelobes, etc, so rmsfac will usually give some "fudge factor"
        greater than 1.

Key: <a name="flux">flux
        An estimate of the total flux of the source.  Giving a good
        total flux will help MOSMEM find a good solution.  On the other
        hand, giving a poor value may do harm.  Normally MOSMEM will NOT
        constrain the total flux to be this value, but see the "doflux"
        option below.  The default is image-dependent for measure=gull,
        and zero for measure=cornwell.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        Task enrichment parameters.  Several can be given, separated by
        commas.  Minimum match is used.  Possible values are:
          doflux     Constraint the flux to be that given by the "flux"
                     parameter.  Normally the "flux" parameter value is
                     only used to determine the default image level.
          verbose    Give lots of messages during the iterations.  The
                     default is to give a one line message at each
                     iteration.
