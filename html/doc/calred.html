Task: calred
Purpose: Analyse flux densities of sources with poor phase stability
Categories: uv analysis, plotting

        CALRED is a program used to analyse flux densities of sources
        where phase stability is poor. It uses either the amplitude of
        the data or an averaged triple product. Normally a point source
        model is assumed, but if a planet is found in the input, CALRED
        uses the model visibility for each baseline/channel to correct
        the calculations.
 
        CALRED produces a table with the following columns:
        Sca (mJy) - the scalar average fluxdensity estimate, calculated
           as the rms of the visibility amplitudes
        Vec (mJy) - the vector average fluxdensity estimate,
            not listed with options=triple
        Tri (mJy) - the triple product fluxdensity estimate, this
           is the cube root of the real part of the average of
           V12*V23*conj(V13) (note that this can be negative).
           Only listed with options=triple.
        Con - the confusion percentage, calculated from the ratio of the
           rms in the imaginary and real component of the triple ampl.
        The - the theoretical noise in mJy
        Act - the actual noise in mJy
        NCorr - the number of correlations contributing

        The input visibility datasets. Several datasets can be given.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        Standard visibility selection. See help on <a href="select.html">select</a> for more
        information.

Key: <a name="line"><a href="line.html">line</a>
        Standard visibility linetype. See the help <a href="line.html">line</a> for more
        information.

Key: <a name="stokes"><a href="stokes.html">stokes</a>
        Normal Stokes/polaization selection. The default is to process
        all parallel-hand polarisation.

Key: <a name="interval">interval
        Seperate estimates of the various parameters are determined for
        data over an interval. This parameter gives the interval, in
        minutes. The default is 5 minutes.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
          triple    Do triple processing.
          nocal     Do not perform gain calibration.
          nopol     Do not perform polarisation calibration on the data.
          nopass    Do not perform bandpass calibration on the data.
          norm      Divide the noise estimates by the square root of the
                    number of points.
