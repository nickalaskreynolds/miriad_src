<h1>Basic Information on im2uv</h1>

Task: im2uv
Purpose: Convert an image to visibilities.
Categories: uv analysis

        This Fourier transforms an image and writes the result as a
        visibility file.  Thus the uv plane sampling pattern is a
        cartesian grid.  Many of the uv variables are given reasonably
        arbitrary values to make the output dataset appear mildly
        sensible.

Key: <a name="model">model
        Input image model. No default.  The model should have units of
        Jy/pixel, eg. a clean component model.  Only a two-dimensional
        model is handled.

Key: <a name="out"><a href="out.html">out</a>
        Output visibility dataset.  No default.

Key: <a name="region"><a href="region.html">region</a>
        The region of interest in the model.  The model is treated as
        zero outside the region of interest.  See the help on <a href="region.html">region</a>
        for more information.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        Visibility data selection - only 'uvrange' selection is
        supported.  See the help on <a href="select.html">select</a> for more information.
