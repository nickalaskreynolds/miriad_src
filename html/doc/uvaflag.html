Task: uvaflag
Purpose: Use flags in one visibility dataset to flag another.
Categories: calibration

        UVAFLAG is a MIRIAD task which flags correlations in one
        visibility dataset based on the flag status of matching
        correlations in a template dataset.
 
        The template dataset should be a subset of the visibility dataset
        being flagged, and the order of records in the two datasets
        should be the same. Normally correlations in the template and
        visibility datasets are matched by comparing time, polarisation,
        baseline, bin and frequency. However options `nopol',`nofreq'
        and 'nobin' can turn off the matching of polarisation, frequency
        and bin  number.

Key: <a name="vis"><a href="vis.html">vis</a>
        The input visibility file to be flagged. No default.

Key: <a name="tvis">tvis
        The template input visibility file. The default is the same
        as the `vis' dataset. This default makes no sense without the
        `nopol' or `nofreq' options. Several files can be given.
        Wildcards are supported.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        Normal visibility selection, which is applied to the template
        dataset. See the help on <a href="select.html">select</a> for more information.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        Extra processing options. Several can be given, separated by
        commas.
        Minimum match is supported. Possible values are:
          nopol  The polarisation of the records in the template are
                 ignored. If any polarisation in the template is
                 flagged, then all polarisations in the input are flagged
                 This can be useful when applying flagging based on one
                 polarisation type (e.g. stokes V) to the other
                 polarisations.
          nofreq The frequency of the correlations in the template are
                 ignored. If any channel in the template is flagged, then
                 all channels in the input are flagged. This can be
                 useful when applying flagging based on a `channel-0'
                 dataset.
          nobin  The bin numbers of the correlations in the template are
                 ignored. If any bin in the template is flagged, then
                 all bins in the input are flagged. This can be useful
                 when applying flagging based on a bin averaged dataset.
          freq   The first baseline of the template is read and the
                 flags are applied to all times, baselines and bins
                 in the input. This can be useful when applying spectral
                 flags based on a small sample of data or time averaged
                 data. Option freq implies nobin. It can be combined
                 with nopol, but not with nofreq.
          noapply Do not apply the flagging, just report the statistics
                 about what would be flagged.
