<h1>Basic Information on uvsplit</h1>

Task: uvsplit
Purpose: Break a uv data-set into single source, single-band files.
Categories: uv analysis

        UVSPLIT breaks an input data-set into a number of output
        data-sets, each of which contains a single ``type'' of data.
        Generally this means single source and single frequency
        band, though this is controlled by some options.
 
        UVSPLIT chooses its own names for the output data-sets. These
        are in the form
            sourcename.frequency
        Where ``frequency'' is the center frequency of the band, in MHz,
        rounded to the nearest MHz.

Key: <a name="vis"><a href="vis.html">vis</a>
        The name if an input uv data-set. No default.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        The normal uv selection commands. The default is copy everything.

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        This gives extra processing options. Several options can be given,
        each separated by commas. They may be abbreivated to the minimum
        needed to avoid ambiguity.
          nocopy    By default, uvsplit copies any calibration tables
                    present in the input to the output. The nocopy
                    option suppresses this.
          mosaic    Typically this option is used when splitting datasets
                    observed in mosaic mode. UVSPLIT attempts to place all
                    pointing centres of the source of interest into the one
                    output dataset. This requires that the field names of
                    the different pointings be composed of two parts,
                    separated by an underscore, viz
                          a_b
                    Where "a" is common to all field names (typically
                    a source) and "b" is a field-specific name (typically
                    a field number). For example field 123 of a mosaic
                    experiment of the LMC might be called "lmc_123"
          clobber   If a dataset exists with the same name as one that
                    uvsplit would create, then delete that dataset before
                    creating uvsplit's output.
          calcode   If splitting by source, take calcode into account
          ifchain   If splitting by freq, take ifchain into account. This
                    can be used to separate two identical frequency
                    setups differing only in the online signal path.
        The following three options determine which data-set characteristics
        result in UVSPLIT generating different output data-sets.
          nosource  Do not produce new data-sets based on source name. That
                    is each output data-set can contain multiple sources.
                    The default is for each output to contain only a single
                    source.
          nofreq    Do not produce new output data-sets based on a switch
                    in frequency. That is each output data-set can contain
                    frequency switches.
          nowindow  Do not generate a separate output data-set for each
                    spectral window. The default is to create a new
                    output for each spectral window.

Key: <a name="maxwidth">maxwidth
         The maximum bandwidth (in GHz) for each output frequency band.
         Default is no subdivision of input bands. The maxwidth limit
         is only applied when splitting by frequency.
