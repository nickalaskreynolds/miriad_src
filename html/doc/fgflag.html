<h1>Basic Information on fgflag</h1>
<pre>

Task: fgflag
Purpose: Apply an AIPS flagging table to visibility data.
Categories: calibration, uv analysis

        FGFLAG is a Miriad task which flags visibility data according to
        the contents of an AIPS flagging table (``AIPS FG'' tables).
        These flagging tables can be created by AIPS, and transfered by
        FITS file. If a visibility FITS file read using Miriad task ``fits''
        contains AIPS FG tables, they will be copied (without applying them)
        to the output Miriad data-set. FGFLAG can then be used to apply these
        flagging tables to the data.
 
        Note: The flagging tables, and information needed to apply them, is
        not copied by any Miriad tasks such as ``uvaver'' or ``uvcat'',
        nor do any other Miriad tasks interpret them. It is best to apply
        the flagging table soon after loading in a FITS file.
 
        Note: The information to flag based upon polarization is lost by
        task ``fits''. Consequently fgflag flags without regard to
        polarization type.
 

Key: <a name="vis"><a href="vis.html">vis</a>
        The input visibility data-set to flag. No default.

Key: <a name="select"><a href="select.html">select</a>
        Normal uv selection. This selects which data to apply the flagging
        table to. Window and amplitude selection are not allowed.
        The default is to apply the flagging table to the entire data-set.

Key: <a name="fgtable">fgtable
        When there are multiple flagging tables in the data-set, this gives
        the table number to apply. The default is the highest versioned
        table.
