Task: tvdisp
Purpose: Display an image on a TV device
Categories: visual display

        TVDISP is a MIRIAD task to display an image on a TV device.
        TVDISP does not clear the screen before it initializes the TV;
        see TVINIT for this function.

Key: <a name="in"><a href="in.html">in</a>
        Standard keyword in. See the help on <a href="in.html">in</a> for more information.
 

Key: <a name="region"><a href="region.html">region</a>
        Standard keyword region. See the help on <a href="region.html">region</a> for more information.
 
        <B>NOTE:</B> This region only permits simple bounding boxes.
        The default is to display the entire image.
 

Key: <a name="range">range
        The minimum and maximum range used in scaling. The default is
        to use the minimum and maximum values of the image.
 

Key: <a name="tvchan">tvchan
        The TV channel to display the image on.  This can be 1 to 3 on
        the IVAS; 1 to 2 on the MXAS or XMTV servers.  The default is 1.
 

Key: <a name="incr">incr
        Only every INCR'th pixel is displayed.  This can take from 1
        to up to 3 values, giving the increment along the x, y, and z
        axis, respectively. The default is chosen such that the selected
        region of each image will fit on the screen.
 

Key: <a name="tvcorn">tvcorn
        This gives the coordinate where the lower left corner of the
        image is displayed.  The coordinate system typically runs from
        1 to 1024 in x and y, the origin being in the lower left corner.
        The default is to center the image on the screen.
 

Key: <a name="server"><a href="server.html">server</a>
        Standard keyword server. See the help on <a href="server.html">server</a> for more information.
 
        There is no default for the server.
 

Key: <a name="options"><a href="options.html">options</a>
        These indicate extra operations that may be performed. One or
        more can be given.  Possible values are:
 
          fiddle  Allow interactive modification of colour tables, zoom,
                  etc.  <B>NOTE:</B> The Fiddle option currently only works
                  with the IVAS servers!
          zoom    Zoom in on the displayed images.  <B>NOTE:</B> Zoom attempts
                  to display the bounding box of all of the displayed
                  images.  If more than one channel was loaded, then
                  the zoomed display will be of the first channel.
          movie   Display the sequence of images as a movie.
                  <B>NOTE:</B> Movie will attempt to zoom onto one image and
                  then center the display step by step through each
                  following image (and then return back to the first
                  image to begin again).  The rate at which the images
                  will change is a function of the cursor's X position.
                  The further to the left of the display that the cursor
                  is located, the faster the rate of change; the further
                  right, the slower.  <B>NOTE:</B> some displays require a
                  mouse button press to identify the cursor position.
                  Functions to control the direction and style of motion
                  are available if the panel is present.  If not, a
                  subset of functions will be available to the four
                  functions A - D (may also be keys F3 - F6).
